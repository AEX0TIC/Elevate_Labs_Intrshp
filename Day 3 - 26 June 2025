## Tools Used:
- Kali Linux VM
- Nessus Essentials

## Steps Performed:
1. Installed Nessus Essentials on Kali Linux.
2. Registered and activated Nessus with a free activation code.
3. Set up a scan target: Local Machine IP (e.g., 192.168.211.1).
4. Configured and initiated a Basic Network Scan.
5. Waited for scan completion (~9 minutes in this case).
6. Exported the scan results to PDF for documentation.

## Scan Findings Summary:
- **Total Vulnerabilities Detected**: 30
    - Critical: 0
    - High: 0
    - Medium: 2
    - Low: 0
    - Info: 28

## Notable Vulnerabilities:
1. **SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted** (Medium, CVSS: 6.5)
    - Issue: Invalid or self-signed SSL certificate.
    - Recommendation: Install a valid CA-signed certificate.

2. **SMB Signing Not Required** (Medium, CVSS: 5.3)
    - Issue: SMB communication not protected against tampering.
    - Recommendation: Enable SMB signing via group policy or registry.

## Additional Info-Level Issues:
- Multiple SMB-related vulnerabilities (versions, dialects, enumeration).
- TLS/SSL misconfigurations (cipher suite issues, version detection).
- Device fingerprinting and traceroute information exposure.
- Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) and OS fingerprinting.
- Missing authentication for some Windows services.

## Mitigation Steps:
- Apply secure configurations (SSL, SMB).
- Disable unused services.
- Regularly patch and update the OS.
- Use firewall rules to limit unnecessary access.
