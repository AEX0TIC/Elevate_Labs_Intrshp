•	The most common port that is found open in 1 and 4 is ssh – open and smtp – filtered.

Port 22 - SSH (Secure Shell) is used for secure remote login and command execution on a server. If found open, it poses certain risks if not properly secured.
 Potential Risks:
•	Brute-force attacks: Hackers may attempt to guess login credentials using automated tools.
•	Weak authentication: If password-based login is enabled with weak credentials, it can be easily compromised.
•	Unpatched vulnerabilities: Older versions of SSH servers may contain known exploits.
•	Privilege escalation: Once inside, an attacker could try to gain root access.
Mitigation:
•	Use key-based authentication.
•	Disable password login.
•	Change default SSH port from 22 to a non-standard port.
•	Use tools like Fail2ban or Deny Hosts to block brute-force attempts.
•	Keep SSH service updated.

Port 25 (SMTP) – Filtered
•	SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending emails. If it is filtered, it means a firewall or security device is actively restricting access to this port.
•	Potential Risks (if it were open or misconfigured):
•	Spam relay: If misconfigured, the server could be used to send spam.
•	Email spoofing: Attackers can spoof emails if SMTP lacks proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
•	Information leakage: Banner grabbing could reveal server software/version.
•	Since it’s “filtered”:
•	This reduces risk because access is restricted.
•	However, it’s worth checking why it is filtered—e.g., by default from cloud providers, or due to mail services not being used on that host.
