1 Open Windows Firewall Settings

    Hit the Start Menu, type:
    Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
    and open it.

    On the left side, click Inbound Rules. This is where all the rules for incoming traffic live.

2️ Block Port 23 (Telnet)

Let’s make a new rule that blocks any connection to port 23:

    On the right side, click “New Rule...”

    Choose Port → Click Next.

    Select TCP → In the box type: 23

    Click “Block the connection” → Next.

    Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public) → Next.

    Give it a name like: Block Telnet Port 23 → Finish.

Done! Now Windows will block anything trying to get through on port 23.

3️ Install Telnet Client (If Not Installed)

To test it, we’ll use the old-school telnet command, but it’s not installed by default.

    Press Windows + R, type: optionalfeatures, and press Enter.

    Scroll down and check "Telnet Client" → Click OK.

    It’ll install in a few seconds.

4️ Test the Block (Does It Work?)

Now let’s see if your rule is working:

    Open Command Prompt (CMD).

    Type: telnet localhost 23.

If your firewall is blocking port 23 properly, you’ll get: Connecting To localhost...Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed.

If the port wasn’t blocked, it might just sit there blinking or show a different message (though in most cases, since nothing is running on port 23, it’ll still fail — we’re just making sure it fails because of the firewall).

5️⃣ Remove the Rule (If You Want to Reset)

Don’t want that rule anymore? Easy:

    Go back to Inbound Rules in the Firewall.

    Find Block Telnet Port 23 → Right-click it → Delete.

That’s it — your firewall is back to its original state.

Picture of the thing is present in the other file inside the same folder only.
