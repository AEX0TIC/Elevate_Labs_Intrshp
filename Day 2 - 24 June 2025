Phishing Email Analysis Report

1. Sample Phishing Email:

    Subject: LastPass Security Notice

    Sender: LastPass LastPass@secure-monitor.com

    Body Summary: Claims suspicious activity was found on the LastPass network and asks users to verify if their data was compromised by clicking a link and entering their login credentials.

2. Sender’s Email Address Analysis:

    Email address: LastPass@secure-monitor.com

    Issue: This is not the official domain of LastPass (which should be something like @lastpass.com).

    Spoofing Indicator: The domain is unrelated and likely impersonating LastPass.

3. Email Header Discrepancies:

    Mail sent via: secure-monitor.com

    No DKIM or SPF verification linked to official LastPass domain

    Discrepancy between sender name and sending domain

4. Suspicious Links or Attachments:

    Contains a hyperlink labeled “this secure web site”

    Real link destination is hidden and could lead to a phishing site

    No attachments in this email, but links are suspicious

5. Urgent or Threatening Language:

    Examples:

        “We wanted to alert you…”

        “Some user vault data was taken…”

        “Enter your login information…”

    This language creates fear and urgency, a common phishing tactic

6. Mismatched URLs:

    Displayed link text appears safe but may lead to a harmful URL

    Hovering over the link would likely show a different, suspicious domain

7. Spelling or Grammar Errors:

    Generally correct grammar, but some awkward phrasing:

        “we can tell you if your account was one that was compromised”

    Slightly unprofessional tone for a security notice

8. Summary of Phishing Traits Identified:

    ✅ Spoofed sender domain

    ✅ Suspicious link requesting credentials

    ✅ Fear/urgency language

    ✅ Generic greeting (“Dear LastPass User”)

    ✅ Misleading hyperlink

    ⚠️ Slightly odd grammar

    ❌ No DKIM/SPF verification

Conclusion:
This email displays multiple clear signs of phishing. Do not click any links or enter login credentials. Always verify such alerts through the official website.
